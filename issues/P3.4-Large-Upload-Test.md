**Status:** To Do
**Priority:** P3-Production (Testing)
**Branch:** `feature/P3.4-large-upload-test`
---

## Overview

Validate the upload performance and reliability with large datasets to ensure production readiness.

---

## User Stories

**As a** QA engineer
**I want** to test uploading 10,000+ files simultaneously
**So that** I can validate the system handles production-scale workloads

**As a** QA engineer
**I want** to test uploading multi-gigabyte files
**So that** I can ensure multipart uploads work correctly and don't timeout

**As a** QA engineer
**I want** to test network interruption scenarios
**So that** I can verify pause/resume functionality works reliably

---

## Requirements

- Test with simulated network share source
- Upload 10,000+ files simultaneously
- Upload files > 1GB
- Verify no timeouts on the web server (direct-to-S3)
- Test pause/resume functionality

---

## Test Plan

### Test 1: Bulk Small Files
- Upload 10,000 small CSV files (1KB each)
- Expected: All files upload successfully
- Metric: Time to complete, success rate

### Test 2: Large File Upload
- Upload single 2GB file
- Expected: Multipart upload completes
- Metric: Upload speed, memory usage

### Test 3: Mixed Workload
- Upload 1000 files of varying sizes (1KB - 100MB)
- Expected: All uploads complete
- Metric: Concurrent upload handling

### Test 4: Network Resilience
- Simulate network interruption mid-upload
- Expected: Resume works correctly
- Metric: Data integrity after resume

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Upload of 10,000+ files completes successfully
- [ ] Upload of 1GB+ files completes successfully
- [ ] UI remains responsive during large uploads
- [ ] No web server timeouts (uploads bypass server)
- [ ] Browser memory stays reasonable (< 2GB)
