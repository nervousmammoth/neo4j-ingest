**Status:** To Do
**Priority:** P5 (Low)
**Branch:** `feature/P5.3-load-test`
---

## Overview

Stress test the production application, specifically the list view with many files and concurrent uploads.

---

## Requirements

- Populate bucket with 10,000+ items
- Measure load time of file grid and sidebar tree
- Test concurrent user uploads
- Optimize if performance degrades

---

## Test Plan

### Test 1: Large Directory Listing
- Populate S3 with 10,000 files in single directory
- Measure: Initial load time, scroll performance
- Target: < 2s initial load, 60fps scroll

### Test 2: Deep Folder Structure
- Create nested folders 10 levels deep
- Measure: Tree expansion time, lazy loading
- Target: < 500ms per folder expansion

### Test 3: Concurrent Uploads
- Simulate 10 concurrent users uploading
- Measure: Upload throughput, server load
- Target: No degradation vs single user

### Test 4: Production Environment
- Deploy to VMware Aria
- Run all tests against production
- Measure: Response times, error rates

## Performance Optimizations (if needed)

1. **Virtualization**: Use react-window for large lists
2. **Pagination**: Implement cursor-based S3 pagination
3. **Caching**: Tune TanStack Query stale times
4. **CDN**: Consider CloudFront for static assets

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] UI remains usable and responsive with 10,000+ items
- [ ] Sidebar tree loads folders in < 500ms
- [ ] File grid scrolls at 60fps
- [ ] Concurrent uploads don't cause server errors
- [ ] Memory usage stays under 2GB in browser
